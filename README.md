JiraJuggler
===========
This project is a small Xamarin App which easily allows you to upload screenshots/images/files as attachments to jira issues.

Currently there is only an Android version, but all network-related and jira-specific code has been written in a portable class library, so it should be fairly easy to write clients to other platforms in the future.
